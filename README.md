In modern daily life, food waste is a constant struggle. In 2010, food waste was estimated to be around 30-40 percent of the food supply in the United States (USDA, 2024). Large family with kids usually have more than 1 storage spaces for food in their household (e.g. fridges, freezers, pantry, etc.) Family with working parents tend to go for larger shopping trip in less frequency and meal prep for the whole week. The struggle with meal planning for the entire week lie with the difficulty in keeping track of ingredients availabilities. The difficulty also increases if a household has more than 1 storage location for their foods. The Food Storage Management database will help a family view and keep track of their current inventories across all of their food storage spaces. In addition, the application will help users identify which ingredients are still needed for their meal plan and add those ingredients to the shopping list for the week. A household usually have 2 10 storage units, and those units can hold from tens to a few hundreds of ingredients, depending on the household size. By identifying the exact ingredients a family may need for the week meal prep, the database can increase shopping efficiency and reduce the chance of buying unnecessary ingredients, which may lead to food waste. <br/>
